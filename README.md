## Easy Doctor backend

<br/>

### Summary

<p>Easy Doctor is an app that you can use to find different doctors and make appointments with them. Appointments can be held on-site or online through the zoom platform.</p>
<p>This repo is for the backend of the project, which was done using NodeJs, expressJs. Also for image upload I used cloudinary and for the online appointments I used the Zoom API. </p>
<p>In this project there are 4 types of users: admin, patients, doctors and clinics/hospitals. All of these users use the same mongo schema.</p>
